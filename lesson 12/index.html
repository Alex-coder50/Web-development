    <h1>Positioning in CSS </h1>
    <p>CSS positioning allows you to control the layout and placement of elements on a webpage. There are several
        positioning methods available in CSS:</p>
    <h2>Static Positioning</h2>
    <p id="i1">This is the default positioning for all HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal
        flow of the document.</p>
    <p>The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language edition of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created by
    Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on 15 January 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition.</p>
    <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
    <p id="i2">Elements are positioned relative to their normal position. You can use the top, right, bottom, and left
        properties to adjust the position.</p>
        <p>The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language edition of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created
            by
            Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on 15 January 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition.</p>
    <h4>Fixed Positioning</h4>
    <p id="i3">Elements are positioned relative to the viewport, which means they stay in the same place even when the
        page is scrolled.</p>

    <h5>Absolute Positioning</h5>
    <p id="i4">Elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other
        than static). If there is no such ancestor, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block
        (usually the viewport).</p>

    <h6>Sticky Positioning</h6>
    <p id="i5">Elements are treated as relative until they reach a specified scroll position, at which point they become
        fixed.</p><p>The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language edition of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created
